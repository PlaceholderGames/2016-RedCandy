Please write what you have done so far in your levels. 

Katherine - I have found a background and got my person to move. Although at the moment when she crashes into the monsters she flies off 
the screen when she crashes into them. 

Muffi - Has done a background and started doing the tiles. She has most of the floor and spikes and has some temporary platforms 
which will be made ginger bread colour.
