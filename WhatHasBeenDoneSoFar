Please write what you have done so far in your levels. 

Katherine - I have found a background and got my person to move. Although at the moment when she crashes into the monsters she flies off 
the screen when she crashes into them. 

Muffi - Has done a background and started doing the tiles. She has most of the floor and spikes and has some temporary platforms 
which will be made ginger bread colour. 

Scott - I have created my character (Axten) and a visual for the projectils he will fire (lasers) using Gimp and have imported them into my level.
I have created a temp sprit for the jelly baby monsters and imported into my level just to represent them during testing.
I have made it so that Axten stands on one spot and fires lasers (he always faces the direction of the cursor).
I have made it so that Jelly baby monsters will spawn at certain points every x seconds (the times will by different for different spawns).
The Jelly baby monsters move up to the top of the level where Axten is but they are yet to kill him and restart the level.
